Your Assignment 1 files go into this directory.  Any files outside this directory will be ignored
by the graders.

You may create subdirectories if you wish, but you're not required to do so.

This folder contains the following files-

updatefolder- This file downloads file from my ucsc directory and uploads it to git automatically. The only argument that this program takes is the commit message.

e.g.
./updatefolder "This is a commit"

then it will ask for the ucsc account password. Once the password is given, everything will be automatic.
